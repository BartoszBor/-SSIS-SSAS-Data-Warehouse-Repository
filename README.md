# -SSIS-SSAS-Data-Warehouse-Repository
This repository contains the source code, documentation, and examples for a data warehouse project that leverages Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS). 
With ETL processes developed in SSIS, an OLAP cube built with SSAS, and reports, the repository offers a scalable and reliable solution for efficient data integration and analysis. 
The code is written in T-SQL, and the project uses Microsoft SQL Server as the underlying data warehouse platform.
The documentation included helps developers understand and contribute to the project.
